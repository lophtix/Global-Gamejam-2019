## Something better than RISK...
...was an attenpt at making a Risk-style strategy board game that was better and less random than Risk, but during testing it turned out to be worse than Risk and the developers redirected their attention to other things...

## Buildule housing tycoon...
Boardgame prototype that started complicated and got somewhat simpler but not finsihed. 

## The unity files in the subdirectories...
...don't bother understanding those.
